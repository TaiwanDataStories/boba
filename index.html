                    <p>As two Taiwanese people living abroad, bubble tea runs in our blood. For the uninitiated, bubble
                        tea is a Taiwanese tea-based drink with tapioca balls also commonly known as “boba.” Although
                        bubble tea can be made with other liquids and toppings, many people often order the standard:
                        milk tea with boba. However, in Taiwan, the birthplace of boba (depending on <a
                            href="https://www.taipeitimes.com/News/feat/archives/2018/11/13/2003704115">which origin
                            story you believe</a>), locals often customize their drinks as if they own the shop! In
                        fact, there are countless more flavors and toppings in Taiwan than we ever see abroad. </p>
                    <p>This made us curious: exactly how many unique boba drinks are there in Taiwan? And after living
                        away from home for more than 10 years, are we missing out on any new developments in the boba
                        scene? To answer these questions, we analyzed drink menus from the top 5 most popular stores as
                        of Feb 2021 according to <a

                    <p>The beauty of bubble tea is in its limitless possibility—you can completely customize your drink
                        to your liking! Even in our study of just five stores, there are 157 unique drinks. Take a

                    tea. All tea shops provide these as well as regular straws, but a growing number of eco-conscious
                    consumers are bringing their own reusable straws made of silicone, glass, or metal. Some tea shops
                    also sell reusable straws.</p>

                    from issuing free plastic bags) so people can easily take their drink for the road. However, just
                    like reusable straws are becoming popular, so are reusable bubble tea holders made of stylish
                    fabric. Some designs even include a convenient pocket for carrying your straw. </p>

                <h3>Data and methods</h3>
                <p>We looked at the drink menus of the five most popular bubble tea shops in Taiwan using data from the
                    <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"
                        href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TeOCwQorr0c&ab_channel=Data66">YouTuber Data66 and Google
                        Trends</a>. These shops include Kebuke, 50 arashi, Ching-Shin Fu-Chuan, Milk Shop, and Ching
                    Yuan.
                </p>
                <p>Using this dataset, we narrowed down the unique drink options to 157 across all of the shops and
                    categorized them according to their base liquid: pure teas, milk teas, milk-based drinks, fruit
                    juice teas, fresh juice, and probiotics. Then we further classified them based on their ingredients.
                    We searched for ingredient lists and images for each drink, and also used our best judgment when
                    necessary. For example, we defined “tea lattes” as drinks that use fresh milk and “milk teas” as
                    drinks that use milk powder. </p>
                <p>Finally, Thomas Nieddu helped us calculate all of the possible drink combinations that can be created
                    with 157 unique drinks, 3 additional toppings, 7 temperature levels, and 5 sweetness levels. <a
